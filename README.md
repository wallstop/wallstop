Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm wallstop, and I love making stuff.

I've spent the past 8 years deep in Unity development, building everything from massive procedural worlds to highly optimized mobile experiences and complex networked games. Beyond that, I have 12 years of professional software engineering experience working on realtime systems, global distributed tech, and all kinds of high-performance, highly available systems.

Currently, I'm the Technical Director/CTO at [The Ambiguous](https://theambiguous.co), an indie game dev studio where we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in interactive media.

Whether it's crafting seamless gameplay or architecting reliable infrastructure at scale, I'm passionate about creating things that work beautifully and perform exceptionally.

Want to chat? Let's connect on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/wallstop).

Thanks for stopping by!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm wallstop, and I love making stuff.

I've spent the past 8 years deep in Unity development, building everything from massive procedural worlds to highly optimized mobile experiences and complex networked games. Beyond that, I have 12 years of professional software engineering experience working on realtime systems, global distributed tech, and all kinds of high-performance, highly available systems.

Whether it's crafting seamless gameplay or architecting reliable infrastructure at scale, I'm passionate about creating things that work beautifully and perform exceptionally.
